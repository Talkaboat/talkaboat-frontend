Kindness Test Claudia Hammond and guests are looking at the place of kindness in today’s world, asking what it really means, what happens in our brains when we act kindly and whether there can ever be a role for it in the cut-throat worlds of business and politics.\n\nAnd with many aspects of kindness remaining under-researched, with your help Claudia will be asking you to fill in the gaps by taking part in the Kindness Test.\n\nwww.thekindnesstest.org\n\nTo launch this major new public science project, Claudia is joined by her guests:\nRobin Bannerjee, Professor of Psychology at the University of Sussex and principal investigator for the Kindness Test\nDan Campbell-Meiklejohn, Lecturer in Psychology and Director of the Social Decision Lab at the University of Sussex\nPinky Lilani, Founder and Chairman of the Women of the Future Programmes that unlocks a culture of kindness among leaders\nJennifer Nadel, co-director of Compassion in Politics\n\nProducer: Erika
